# ðŸ§  Turing Machine Simulator in Golang

A formal, academic-grade simulator for deterministic Turing machines, written in Go.

This project implements a general-purpose **Turing Machine (TM) simulator** capable of parsing machine definitions and simulating their step-by-step execution. It is built with educational clarity and structural rigor in mind, aimed at illustrating the principles of computability theory and formal models of computation.

## ðŸ“˜ Project Description

This simulator accepts a Turing Machine definitionâ€”comprising states, symbols, transitions, and an initial tape configurationâ€”and runs the computation based on deterministic transition rules.

The goal is to bridge theoretical foundations of computation with real-world programming by:

- Translating abstract machine definitions into concrete simulation
- Reinforcing the Churchâ€“Turing thesis via a programmable model
- Demonstrating how high-level languages like Go can simulate universal computation

> ðŸ§© **Applications**: This simulator can be used for educational demonstrations, testing custom TMs, or validating formal properties of languages defined over TMs.

## ðŸ’¡ Features

- Accepts TM definitions in clean JSON format
- Supports arbitrary alphabets and tape sizes
- Handles right (`R`), left (`L`), and neutral (`N`) head movements
- Detects acceptance, rejection, and halting conditions
- Customizable initial tape and head position
- Step-limited simulation to avoid infinite loops

ðŸ“š Theoretical Context

This project directly implements concepts from the Theory of Computation, particularly:

    Deterministic Turing Machines (DTM)

    Formal languages and automata

    Acceptance/rejection conditions

    Churchâ€“Turing thesis (simulation of computation)

Such simulations illustrate that any computable function can be modeled algorithmically and verified symbolicallyâ€”core ideas in theoretical computer science
